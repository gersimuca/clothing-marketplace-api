## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Java 17**: The application requires Java Development Kit (JDK) 17.
- **Maven**: Make sure you have Apache Maven installed to manage dependencies and build the project.
- **Docker**: For running PostgreSQL and pgAdmin in containers, ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:gersimuca/clothing-marketplace-api.git
   cd clothing-marketplace-api
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the docker directory of the project to set up your environment variables for the PostgreSQL database. Here is a sample:

   ```bash
   POSTGRES_USER=gersi
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=gersi
   POSTGRES_DB=clothing_marketplace
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

3. **Build the project**:
   Use Maven to build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Configuration

This project uses a Docker Compose file to set up a PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin. Ensure the following configurations are set in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

- **PostgreSQL**:
    - **User**: `${POSTGRES_USER:-gersi}`
    - **Password**: `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-gersi}`
    - **Database**: `${POSTGRES_DB:-clothing_marketplace}`

- **pgAdmin**:
    - **Email**: `${PGADMIN_EMAIL:-gersimuca@aol.com}`
    - **Password**: `${PGADMIN_PASSWORD:-gersimuca}`

Modify these values as necessary to fit your environment.

## Running the Application

To run the application with Docker Compose, execute the following command in the docker directory of the project:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will start the PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin. Once the services are up and running, you can start the Spring Boot application.

In another terminal, run:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Your application will be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running Tests

To run the tests included in the project, execute:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will execute all the unit and integration tests defined in the project.

### Notes:

- Ensure you replace `your_secret_key` with a secure JWT secret key in file.
- The Docker commands assume you are running the services in a Unix-like environment. Adjust accordingly for Windows.
- You can modify the structure and content of the `README.md` based on your project needs and style preferences.
- Make sure to create a `LICENSE` file in your repository if you mention licensing in the README.
